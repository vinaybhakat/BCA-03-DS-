# BCA-03-DS
This repository is for all of us (BCA Semester 3, Data Structures subject).
We will push all the programs we learn in class here.

## How this repo works
1. Each student has a folder with their name.<br>
**Example:**<br>
`/Rishabh`<br>
`/Aryan`  <br>
`/Anish `<br>
2. Inside your folder, add all your programs.<br>
Example for array code:

`/Rishabh/array.c`<br>
`/Rishabh/linkedlist.c`<br>  
3. Push your code after class or when assignment is given.
## Rules
- Do not touch other student’s folder.
- Keep filenames simple and meaningful (array.c, stack.c).
- Always write your name in comments inside the code.
- Learn Git basics: git add ., git commit -m "message", git push.
- Be respectful — this repo is for learning together.

##  This repo is for practice + teamwork.
Every push you do = more learning for you
